# MagicMirror

This is a Magic mirror written in Node and where we get Date & Time, Weather, Busstiming (Malm√∂, Sweden), Todo-list, RSS- flow (Sydsvenskan) and a text in the middle


The text in the middle is changeable and so is the wehaterlocation and you are able to add todos.

I use mLab MongoDB as the db and Openweather for the weather.
